# Convert RAW Images to JPEG

- This is a program to convert RAW images in a given folder 
- It makes uses of imageMagick library, therfore you need to install it. You can see more at imagemagick.org
- Via NODEjs we read from user the folder where the files are located. Remember not using apostrophe, writte only the path. 
- the program will read the path and execute a shell and run the imageMagick convert command 
- It will run a for loop over all files, so it may take a while...

- hope it helps you :)
